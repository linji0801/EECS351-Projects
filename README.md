# EECS351-Projects
Three Projects from EECS351 (Computer Graphic) in 2018 Winter Quarter.

1. The goal of the first project is to learn enough WebGL to make an interactive drawing that you are interested in and compelling.
2. The goal of the second project is to create a three-dimensional world with interesting shapes that the viewer can explore.
3. The goal of the third project is to create a world where the user can explore with different lighting/shading methods illuminating the shapes.
